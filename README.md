# Statistical Analysis of MechaCar

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
~del1_results.png
 - which var/coeffs provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg?
 - is the slope of the linear model considered to be 0? why/not?
 - does linear model predict mgp of MechaCar prototypes effectively? why/not?

 ## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
 ~del2_totalsummary.png
 ~del2_lotsummary.png
 Design specifications dictate that var must not >100 psi.
 - does current manuf data meet this design spec for all lots in total and each lot indiv? why/not?

 ## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

- what metric(s) are you going to test?
- what is the null & alternative hypothesis?
- what stat test would you use to test the hypothesis? why?
- what data is needed to run the stat test?
